# MEANING 

- These are macro molecules that transfer and store genetic information. 

# TYPES && CLASSES

- they usually fall to the classes according to the nature of their sugars 

1. Ribonucleic acids (RNA) they contain ribose sugar

2. Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) they contain deoxyribose sugar

# Similarities between RNA and DNA

- both contain building blocks called nucleotides, a nucleotide is made up of a nitrogenous base, a sugar and a phosphoric acid. 

- the nitrogenous base is a purine or a derivative of pyrimidine

- the two major purines found in nucleic acid are Adenine and Guanine

- the 3 major pyrimidies found in nucleic acids of both procaryotes and eucaryotes are cytosine, uracil and thymine

# DNA 
- DNA consists 4 bases namely adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine

# RNA 
- RNA consists of 4 bases but in a place of thymine there is uracil therefore it's adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil. 

- other purines found in nucleic acids is xanthine, hypoxanthine and uric acids.

- uric acid is formed as an end product of purine catabolism in humans. 

chemical formular of coffee is ("1,3,7 trimethyl xanthine").

- pyrimidine nucleosides include cytidine and uridine.

- the deoxyrinucleoside of thymine is called thymidine and non-deoxythymidine

- nucleotides are nucleosides phosphorylated on one or morehydroxyl groups of the sugar e.g ("adenosine monophosphate (AMP) ").

## The only sugar attached to a tracil is ribose and its commonly attached to thymine is deoxyribose. 

- the common site of esterification is the hydroxyl group attached to the C-5 of the pentose. 
- compounds that do the above are called (nucleoside 5-phosphate or a 5' - nucleotide)

## WHAT IS ESTERIFICATION???

## NUCLEOSDIES                      MONOPHOSPHATE NUCLEOTIDES               OTHER NUCLEOTIDES
1. uracil + ribose = uridine       uridylic acid/uridine 5 phosphate           UDP,  UTP 
2. cytosine + deoxyribose          deoxycytidine monophosphate dCMP            dCDP, dCTP
   = deoxycytidine
3. adenine + ribose = adenosine     adenylic acid, AMP                         ADP,  ATP-
4. adenine + deoxyribose =          deoxyadenosine monophosphate dAMP          dADP, dATP
   deoxyadenosine  

## FUNCTIONS OF NUCLEOTIDES
1. they are activated precursors of DNA and RNA
2. nucleotide derivatives
