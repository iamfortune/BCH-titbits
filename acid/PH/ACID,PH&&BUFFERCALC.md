## NOTE ON ACIDS, PH AND BUFFERS

## b === base, a === acid

- Bronstel-Lowry defined acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. they work together to form a Ca and Cb pair. 
- HCO3- (b) + H2O ----> H2CO3 (Ca) + OH- (Cb)

- Lewis defined acid as a an electron acceptor (electrophile) and a base as nucleophile, they workn together to form a convalent bond
