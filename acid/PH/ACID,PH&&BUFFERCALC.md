## NOTE ON ACIDS, PH AND BUFFERS

## b === base, a === acid

- Bronstel-Lowry defined acid as a proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. they work together to form a Ca and Cb pair. 
- HCO3- (b) + H2O ----> H2CO3 (Ca) + OH- (Cb)

- Lewis defined acid as a an electron acceptor (electrophile) and a base as nucleophile, they workn together to form a convalent bond 
-  A+(a) + B+(b) -----> A-B (co-ordinate convalent bond)

- PH - when water is pure, it dissociates to H+ and OH-
- H2O ----> H+  +  OH-  at 25'C
- at 25'C, [H+] = [OH-] = 10^-7m in pure water 

dissociation constant of pure water Kw=[OH-][H+]=10^-14m
conveniently Ph = -log10[H+]

PH is a measure of the acidity of a solution, so the lower the ph, the higher the acidity of the solution.
