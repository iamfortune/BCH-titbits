# QUESTION 1
- Find the ph of a solution of 0.00005m NaOH
- solution

[OH-] = 5x10^-5m
pOH = -log10[OH-]
= -log10[5.0x10^-5m] = 4.30
pkw = PH + POH = 14
PH = 14 - 4.30 = 9.7

# Question 2
- Repsin is a digestive enzyme in our stomach and has a ph of 1.5. find the concentration of hydroxide ion in the stomach

- solution
