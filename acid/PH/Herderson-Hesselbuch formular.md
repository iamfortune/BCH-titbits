# Definition
- the PH of a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base is related to the concentration of the acid and base and the pka.

# HENDERSON HESSELBUCH FORMULAR
-       ka = [H+][A-]
            ---------
              [HA]
log ka = log[H+] + log[A-]
                      [HA]

apply the definition of ph and pka

-log[H+] = -logka + log[A-]
                       [HA]
        PH = pka + log[A-]
                      [HA]

# NOTE that this equatipon is useful in determining the properties of buffer solution
